Raspberry Pi scripts to send shairport metadata NowPlaying info to LCD screen

This is a set of scripts which get metadata info from ShairPort, read it and send it to an LCD screen plugged to your Raspberry Pi. I've made this for the Pimoroni dot3k (DisplayOTron 3000) screen but it can be adapted to any LCD I suppose. Here are the main steps explained bellow.

1°) Get and install all the pre-requisites:

1.1°) You need ShairPort to make your RPi able to get Airplay streams. Get this from here : https://github.com/abrasive/shairport
there is a good tutorial here http://raspberrypihq.com/how-to-turn-your-raspberry-pi-into-a-airplay-receiver-to-stream-music-fro

1.2°) You also need to setup your LCD Screen depending on the model you use. In my case i used Pimoroni dot3k. Get it here: https://github.com/pimoroni/dot3k
